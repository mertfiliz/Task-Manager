# Task-Manager
2015

This program works as a task manager. There are daily, weekly, monthly and yearly tabs that you can put your desired tasks to later complete them. 
When you finish writing your tasks on the manager, you can save it and when you open again, your tasks will be loaded. 
If the user pushes the remove button the task will be removed. There is a password protection to keep your tasks private. There is also a
section, that you can change your password.
